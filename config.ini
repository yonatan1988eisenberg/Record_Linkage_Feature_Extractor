description = This programs calculates the features or row pairs. It's input is the name of the city and its output is
              a csv file containing the features as calculated using record linkage technique. From the city name
              the program finds the path to a folder containing csv files. After the csv files are concatenated to
              a raw dataframe it's rows are sorted by the columns indicated in the 'sort_cols' parameter and rows
              with duplicated values in the columns indicated by the 'drop_cols' parameter are removed, keeping only
              the first row. Then, the program follows a standard record linkage process; preprocessing, indexing,
              comparing and computing, to build a dataset of two row's indexes and their features.

city_help = The name of the city. The program search for csv files in the path 'user/data/<city>'.

remove_duplicates_help = A boolean indicating if to delete duplicates, Default is True.

sort_cols = number_of_reviews
sort_cols_help = Comma separated names of column(s) to sort the raw data by before removing duplicates (the order matters), only the
                 first row of each duplicates set will be kept. Default is 'number_or_reviews'.

drop_cols = name address about
drop_cols_help = Comma separated names of column(s) to find duplicates by. Default is 'name address about'.

index_by = Full:None
index_by_help = Comma separated method:column pairs indicating the indexing method ('Full', 'Block',
                'SortedNeighbourhood' or 'Random') and the appropriate column(s) if required. Default is 'Full:None'.

compare_cols = name address about
compare_cols_help = Comma separated names of column(s) to compare two rows by. Default is 'name address about'.

algos = jaro jarowinkler levenshtein damerau_levenshtein qgram cosine smith_waterman lcs
algos_help = Comma separated names of algorithms to use in the feature compering stage. Default is 'jaro jarowinkler
             levenshtein  damerau_levenshtein qgram cosine smith_waterman lcs'.
